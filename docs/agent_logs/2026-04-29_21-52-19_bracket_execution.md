## Pass 0 — Pre-flight (online research, doctrine reads, MAP draft, leases)

- pass number: 0
- timestamp: 2026-04-29 21:52:19 -04:00
- files changed:
  - Operations_Turtle_Shell_Artifacts/STRATEGY_TO_BROKER_BRACKET_PROGRAM.md (new)
  - docs/agent_logs/2026-04-29_21-52-19_bracket_execution.md (this file)
  - COORDINATION/LOCKS.md (leases pending)
  - COORDINATION/INBOX_CODEX.md (heads-up pending)
- decisions made:
  - D1–D10 in MAP §7 (default mode = post_fill_bracket, native is optional, doctrine name = ExecutionPlan, OCO is the post-fill exit pair, ProtectiveOrderPlacer is a subscriber, idempotency key = (signal_plan_id, covered_qty_breakpoint), TOCTOU fix = single conn + WAL, daily-state source = BrokerSync, Alpaca capabilities defaults to false until T-4, production-grade only).
- blockers and 5 Whys:
  - none — pre-flight completed.
- tests run:
  - baseline: backend `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit -q` → 1476 passed.
  - baseline: frontend `npm test --run` → 379 passed across 51 files.
- test results:
  - both green at handoff baseline.
- remaining gaps:
  - all 7 slices pending implementation.
- next action:
  - file leases, file Codex heads-up, begin T-1 (persistence trio).

## Pass 1 — T-1 baseline (persistence trio)

- pass number: 1 (T-1 baseline)
- timestamp: 2026-04-29 22:30:00 -04:00
- files changed:
  - `backend/app/domain/execution_style.py` (added `ExecutionMode` enum + `execution_mode` field on `ExecutionStyleVersion` + doctrine docstring)
  - `backend/app/deployments/models.py` (added `strategy_controls_version_id`, `execution_plan_version_id`, `risk_plan_version_id` to `Deployment` + `DeploymentWriteRequest`)
  - `backend/app/deployments/service.py` (round-trip new FKs in `create_deployment` + `update_deployment`)
  - `backend/app/strategy_controls/{__init__,models,persistence}.py` (new package — `StrategyControlsRepository`, `StrategyControlsVersionRecord`, `StrategyControlsVersionNotFoundError`)
  - `backend/app/execution_plans/{__init__,models,persistence}.py` (new package — `ExecutionPlanRepository`, `ExecutionPlanVersionRecord`, `ExecutionPlanVersionNotFoundError`)
  - `backend/app/strategy_composer/service.py` (constructor accepts both repos; `save_draft` now persists controls + plan; helpers return `(payload, persisted_version_id)` tuples)
  - `backend/app/api/routes/strategies.py` (composer route now wires both repos against the runtime DB)
  - `backend/tests/unit/strategy_controls/test_strategy_controls_repository.py` (new — 6 reload-survival tests)
  - `backend/tests/unit/execution_plans/test_execution_plan_repository.py` (new — 6 reload-survival tests, includes native_alpaca_bracket round-trip)
  - `backend/tests/unit/strategy_composer/test_save_draft_persists_versioned_components.py` (new — 3 acceptance tests)
- decisions made:
  - D3 in MAP: Python class identity stays `ExecutionStyleVersion`; new persisted entity uses doctrine name `execution_plan_versions` (table) + `execution_plan_version_id` (FK). Renaming the 94 import sites is a follow-up slice. No parallel paths — there is one model class and one persistence path.
  - Deployment is the binder: FKs `strategy_controls_version_id`, `execution_plan_version_id`, `risk_plan_version_id` go on `deployments`, not on `strategy_versions`. Locked in `feedback_deployment_is_the_binder.md` memory entry.
  - `_persist_*` helpers return `(payload, version_id)` tuples; `version_id` is `None` when no repo is wired (test harness without persistence). The response only carries the version_id when the row is actually durable.
- blockers and 5 Whys: none — T-1 baseline shipped cleanly.
- tests run:
  - `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/strategy_composer backend/tests/unit/strategy_controls backend/tests/unit/execution_plans backend/tests/unit/deployments -q` → 76 passed.
  - `python -m pytest backend/tests/unit -q` → 1497 passed (+21 over baseline 1476).
- test results: all green; zero regressions.
- remaining gaps:
  - DeploymentRepository doesn't yet have explicit `WHERE execution_plan_version_id=...` indexed lookups (the payload column captures the FK as JSON). Index columns added in T-3 if the orchestrator's resolver needs them.
  - Frontend zod schemas don't yet expose `execution_mode` / the version ids. Done in T-2.
- next action: commit T-1 baseline, then start T-2 (Compose UI bracket params + execution_mode selector + buildRequest dehardcoding).

## Alpaca verification (online + SDK source, locked 2026-04-29 21:50:00 -04:00)

- alpaca-py SDK version present at `.venv/Lib/site-packages/alpaca/`.
- `OrderClass` enum supports BRACKET, OCO, OTO, SIMPLE, MLEG.
- `TakeProfitRequest(limit_price)` + `StopLossRequest(stop_price, [limit_price])` are the canonical bracket child specs.
- Native bracket TIF = day | gtc only.
- Native bracket extended_hours = false.
- Native bracket + fractional / notional = NOT supported.
- Native bracket short side: supported (ETB symbols, account ≥ $2,000 equity).
- Concurrent long+short brackets on the same symbol: forbidden.
- Notional orders cannot be replaced.
- Fractional sells always marked long.
